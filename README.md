# Hardcore Unlocked
A modification of the Hardcore addon which allows for variable rulesets.  This addon will __not__ qualify you for the Hardcore community challenge.

## Motivation and Demographic
- Enable players who do not want to follow the Solo-Self Found ruleset, to enjoy the Hardcore Addon features (Achievements, Death Alerts, Death log)
- Enable players to craft their own ruleset.  Players can activate their preferred ruleset from a collection of rules.
- Enable guilds to enforce their own ruleset.  Guilds can use officer notes to create a guild-wide ruleset.  Players in a guild with a guild-wide ruleset will have their addons automatically enable the rules in the guild-wide ruleset.
- Enable players who hit level 60 to follow their elite guild's ruleset.

## Features

### Variable Ruleset
Mix and match rules to cater to your Hardcore journey.  Join guilds with guild-wide rulesets to automatically participate.

### Removed Security Components
Rules in this addon function as guiderails and there is no "Failure" that can be appealed.  For example, the `No Auction House` rule will close the auction house if you attempt to open interact with the auctioneer, as opposed to applying a `failed` status to your characer.

### TODO before release
- UI for choosing ruleset
  - Toggles for rules
  - Apply Button (only if not in guild with guild-set)
  - Officer Notes parser
  - Code Generator
  - Hyperlink generator, view ruleset via chat hyperlinks
- Code transmitted in player whisper (To view other player's rulesets)
